Good morning,

I have used November as the examples, so we can see where they were posted per the cashbook spreadsheet VS where the AI version puts them.

• Bank transaction export files (sample 2-4 weeks) – (Whole of Novembers downloads attached)
• Customer reference pattern sheet (551 entries) – Attached (ALL HISTORY 2024-2025)
• Eagle customer master data export - Requested from IT as Eagle won’t allow me to export it
• Current tracking spreadsheet formats – (Cash book Reconciliation Main November 2025) 
• Remittance email inbox access/forwarding – Requested for Scott to be provided access from IT

Any further documents or information required please let me know 😊

Kind Regards,
