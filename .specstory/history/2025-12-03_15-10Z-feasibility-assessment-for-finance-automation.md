# Feasibility assessment for finance automation (2025-12-03 15:10Z)

_**User (2025-12-03 15:10Z)**_

You are a senior solution architect specializing in finance automation for SMEs.



PROJECT CONTEXT:

Read the README.md in this project for full context. Key points:

- Client: Liquidline Limited (£50M manufacturing/distribution)

- Goal: Automate 70-80% of manual cash posting & bank reconciliation

- Timeline Constraint: Must deliver before May 2027 ERP replacement (18 months)

- Users: Curtis (cash posting 35-40h/week), Erin (bank rec 20-30h/week)

- Current Cost: £78,000/year in manual labor

- Target Savings: £58,500/year with 70-80% automation



TECHNICAL CONTEXT:

- Full workflow analysis available in /context/manus-analysis.md (1,900 lines)

- Real spreadsheet samples in /data/ folder

- Tech stack: n8n, Supabase, Python, Claude API, Eagle ERP integration

- Your experience: Solo consultant + 2 offshore PHP devs (Donni/Mitch at $10-12/hour)



CRITICAL QUESTION TO ANSWER:

**Can we realistically deliver 70-80% automation in 6 weeks for £13,500, or do we need more time/budget?**



YOUR TASK:

Create a detailed, honest technical implementation plan that answers:



═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PART 1: FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════



Based on the Manus analysis and technical requirements:



1. **Is 6 weeks realistic for 70-80% automation?**

   - YES: Explain what gets delivered in 6 weeks

   - NO: State realistic timeline (8 weeks? 10 weeks? 12 weeks?)



2. **What's achievable in different timeframes?**

   - 6 weeks: X% automation (be specific)

   - 8 weeks: Y% automation

   - 10 weeks: Z% automation

   - 12 weeks: Target 75-80%



3. **What are the HARD technical blockers?**

   - Eagle SQL access (do we NEED it or can we work around?)

   - AI matching accuracy (can Claude API achieve 80%+ with available data?)

   - Remittance auto-capture (realistic accuracy with OCR/parsing?)

   - Group One complexity (169 BMW accounts - automatable?)



═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PART 2: IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP (Week-by-Week)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════



Create detailed week-by-week plan:



**WEEK 1: Foundation**

- Day 1-2: [Specific tasks]

- Day 3-4: [Specific tasks]

- Day 5: [Specific tasks]

- Deliverables: [What's working by end of week 1?]

- Who does what: [Scott vs Donni/Mitch split]



**WEEK 2: [Phase name]**

[Same detail level]



**WEEK 3-6: [Continue]**



For EACH week, specify:

- Exact tasks (not vague like "build matching engine" - be specific)

- Who builds it (Scott vs offshore devs)

- Estimated hours (Scott's time vs offshore time)

- What's demoable at end of week

- Technical risks for that week



═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PART 3: COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════



Design the actual system components:



**Component 1: Remittance Auto-Capture**

- Technology: n8n + Claude API

- Build complexity: [Simple/Medium/Complex]

- Build time: X days

- Success criteria: Capture 75% of remittances automatically

- Edge cases: [What requires manual handling?]

- Code modules needed: [List specific Python scripts, n8n workflows]



**Component 2: AI Customer Matching**

- Technology: Python + Claude API + Supabase

- Build complexity: [rating]

- Build time: Y days

- Training data: 551 AKA patterns + transaction history

- Success criteria: 80% accuracy on customer identification

- Edge cases: [List the 20% that needs manual review]

- Code modules needed: [Be specific]



**Component 3-5: [Continue for all components]**



For EACH component:

- Exact tech stack

- Build complexity rating (hours estimate)

- Success criteria (measurable)

- What offshore devs can build vs what needs Scott

- Integration points with Eagle/spreadsheets

- Error handling approach



═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PART 4: EAGLE ERP INTEGRATION STRATEGY

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════



Critical decision point:



**Option A: SQL Direct Access**

- Pros: [List advantages]

- Cons: [List risks]

- Requires: SQL read/write access from Matt

- Build complexity: [Hours]

- Risk level: [High/Medium/Low]



**Option B: Export/Import via Excel**

- Pros: [List advantages]

- Cons: [List limitations]

- Requires: Eagle export capabilities (confirmed available)

- Build complexity: [Hours]

- Risk level: [High/Medium/Low]



**Option C: Hybrid Approach**

- SQL read for customer/invoice data

- Excel import for posting transactions

- Pros/Cons/Complexity



**RECOMMENDATION:** [Which option and why?]



═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PART 5: MVP vs FULL SCOPE

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════



Define what's in/out:



**MVP (Minimum Viable Product) - Week 6:**

- ✅ [Feature 1 - definitely included]

- ✅ [Feature 2 - definitely included]

- ✅ [Feature N]

- ❌ [Feature X - cut from MVP]

- ❌ [Feature Y - phase 2]

- **Automation Coverage:** X% (be realistic)



**Full Scope - Week 8-10:**

- ✅ [Additional features to reach 75-80%]

- **Automation Coverage:** 75-80%



**Future Enhancements (Not in initial project):**

- [List "nice to haves" that aren't essential]



═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PART 6: RISK REGISTER

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════



List EVERY risk that could derail this project:



**RISK 1: [Name]**

- Probability: High/Medium/Low

- Impact: High/Medium/Low

- Mitigation: [Specific action plan]

- Contingency: [What if mitigation fails?]



[Continue for all risks identified in Manus analysis]



Key risks to address:

- Eagle access limitations

- AI matching accuracy below 75%

- Remittance format variability

- Group One automation complexity

- Curtis/Erin user adoption resistance

- Timeline slippage

- Scope creep



═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

OUTPUT FORMAT

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════



Provide your analysis as:



1. **Executive Summary** (2-3 paragraphs)

   - Can we deliver 70-80% in 6 weeks? YES/NO/CONDITIONAL

   - Recommended timeline: X weeks

   - Recommended budget: £Y

   - Confidence level: Z%



2. **Detailed Implementation Plan** (week-by-week)

3. **Component Architecture** (technical specs)

4. **Risk Assessment** (what could go wrong)

5. **Cost Breakdown** (honest numbers)

6. **Go/No-Go Recommendation** (clear decision)



Be brutally honest. It's better to say "8 weeks" now than promise 6 and fail.



Consider:

- You're a solo consultant with 2 offshore devs (not a team of 15)

- Client needs this before May 2027 (18 months)

- £13,500 was our initial guess - adjust if needed

- Reputation matters more than winning this one project

- Under-promise, over-deliver is the strategy



Begin analysis now.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user is asking me to create a detailed technical implementation plan for a finance automation project. Before I can create this plan, I need to read the key context files to understand the full scope:

1. README.md - for project context
2. /context/manus-analysis.md - the detailed workflow analysis (1,900 lines)
3. Potentially look at the data files to understand the actual spreadsheet formats

Let me start by reading these files to understand what we're dealing with.</details></think>

---

I'll need to thoroughly review the project context before creating a comprehensive implementation plan. Let me read the key files first.

This is a comprehensive analysis request. I've now read both the README and the manus-analysis.md files. Let me also look at the data files to understand the actual spreadsheet structures and get a better sense of the real-world data we're working with. This will help me make more accurate estimates.

Key observations from the documents:
1. The manus analysis suggests a 44-week timeline with 12-15 FTE resources - this is WAY too long and expensive
2. The README suggests 6-12 weeks with a target of £13,500
3. There's a massive disconnect between the manus analysis (enterprise approach) and the actual project constraints (solo consultant + 2 offshore devs)

I need to look at the data files to understand:
- The actual format of the bank downloads
- The AKA sheet structure
- The bank rec workbook structure

Let me examine the data folder to understand what we're working with.</details></think>

Let me examine the CSV files and understand the data structures we're working with:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
This is incredibly useful data! The bank download CSV shows me exactly what Curtis is working with. Let me note the key observations:

1. **Transaction Volume**: Just this one day (21 Nov 25) has 180+ transactions - far more than the "90+" mentioned in the analysis
2. **Transaction Types**: Mix of:
   - Bank Giro Credits (most common - customer payments)
   - Faster Payments (customer payments)
   - Direct Debits/BACS Payments (outgoing supplier payments)
   - CHAPS/International
   - Sweeping

3. **Customer Reference Patterns**: I can see real patterns now:
   - "SI-XXXXXX" invoice numbers (e.g., SI-794931, SI-770108)
   - Customer codes (e.g., LIQ001, LIQU1, HLIQU010)
   - Customer names in transaction detail (e.g., "FTI CONSULTING LLP", "CVS UK LIMITED")
   - Group One references! (e.g., "GROUP 1 JLR" on line 85 - "GROUP1 RETAIL")
   - ACA references (lines 162-168) - these are likely Group One BMW/dealership accounts
   - Reference formats vary wildly

4. **Amounts**: Range from £10.80 to £253,350.94

5. **Group One Pattern**: I can see "GROUP 1 JLR" and "GROUP1 RETAIL" on line 85, plus multiple "ACA" prefixed accounts (ACA STIRLING VAUXH, ACA KIRKCALDY BMW, ACA BLACKPOOL RENA, etc.) - these appear to be the BMW dealership accounts

Let me also check the other CSV file that was too large - I'll read just the first portion to understand its structure.</details></think>

The ExportFile is too large. Let me read just the first portion to understand its structure:
